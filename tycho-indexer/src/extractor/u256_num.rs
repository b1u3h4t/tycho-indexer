/// Converts a U256 integer into it's closest floating point representation
///
/// Rounds to "nearest even" if the number has to be truncated (number uses more than 53 bits).
///
/// ## Rounding rules
/// This function converts a `U256` value to a `f64` value by applying a rounding
/// rule to the least significant bits of the `U256` value. The general rule when
/// rounding binary fractions to the n-th place prescribes to check the digit
/// following the n-th place in the number (round_bit). If it’s 0, then the number
/// should always be rounded down. If, instead, the digit is 1 and any of the
/// following digits (sticky_bits) are also 1, then the number should be rounded up.
/// If, however, all of the following digits are 0’s, then a tie breaking rule is
/// applied using the least significant bit (lsb) and usually it’s the ‘ties to even’.
/// This rule says that we should round to the number that has 0 at the n-th place.
/// If after rounding, the significand uses more than 53 bits, the significand is
/// shifted to the right and the exponent is decreased by 1.
