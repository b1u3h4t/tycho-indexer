# Bounties

In some cases, the community sponsors a bounty.

{% endhint %}

Specifically for:

* **DEX Integrations**: Some DEXs can't integrate themselves - and instead sponsor a bounty for the community.
* **Orderflow integrations**: Tools that want to use Tycho in their router.
* **Tycho X Projects**: Teams can also sponsor bounties for Tycho X projects.

### How bounties work

* **Cumulative Bounties**: Several parties can sponsor and cumulate a bounty for the same issue.
* **Single winner**: Bounties are, unless specified otherwise, awarded in full to the first team that satisfies the requirements.
* **Core Maintainer Support**: Tycho maintainers will support every team working on a bounty. Incl. guidance, PR reviews, and final assessment.
* **Award of a Bounty**: Each bounty has a board of three assessors, usually the one who specified the bounty, the sponsor of the bounty, and one dev from the Tycho team.

### Steps

* **Discover a bounty**: Find current open bounties in the â€“ [Bounty Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mVA1sSF70lesJL2cKPeidmU1K2urb4GCPl0zumJaLaU/edit?usp=sharing).
* **Reach out**: Reach out to Tycho maintainers at [tycho.build](http://tycho.build/) or dm [Tanay](https://t.me/tanay_j) if you plan to work on a bounty.
* **Submit**: Submit your work in a PR and notify maintainers.
* **Review & Award**: After a successful review by the three assessors, maintainers will merge the PR and payout the bounty. (any merged PR automatically qualifies for the bounty.)
