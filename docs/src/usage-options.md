# Usage Options

Tycho can be utilized in two primary ways, depending on your needs and preferences:

## 1. Using Tycho as a Service

If you prefer a managed solution with minimal setup, you can use Tycho as a service:

- **WebSocket and RPC Access**: Gain real-time access to protocol states and updates via WebSocket connections and RPC endpoints.
- **No Maintenance**: Let us handle the infrastructure, updates, and scaling, so you can focus on integrating Tycho's data into your applications.

For more details, see the [Using Tycho as a Service](./using-tycho-as-a-service.md) section.

## 2. Self-Hosting Tycho [coming soon]

If you prefer full control over your infrastructure or need to customize Tycho, you can choose to self-host:

- **Open Source**: Use the provided code to deploy and manage Tycho on your own servers.
- **Customization**: Modify the code to fit your specific needs, whether it’s for scaling, customization, or integration with other tools.
- **Deployment Flexibility**: Deploy Tycho in your environment, whether it’s on-premises, in the cloud, or within a private network.
